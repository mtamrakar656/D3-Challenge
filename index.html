          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Household Income, Poverty, Age</h2>
          <hr>
          <h4>Household Income</h4>
          <p>From the plot, it is visible that the states having lower Household Incomes were prone to lacking Healtcare as 
            compared to states that had higher Household Incomes. Also, the smoking levels and obesity rates were higher for 
            the states with lower Household Incomes compared to states with higher income levels. </p>
          <hr>

          <h4>In Poverty</h4>
          <p>Although the median household income may be higher for a state, the poverty level for that state could be lower. For example,
            Maryland has a higher household income than most states but the poverty level is among the lowest. In regards to the 
            poverty level, the obesity, smoking levels, and lack in healthcare were higher in the states with the lowest poverty levels.
          </p>
          <hr>
          
          <h4>Age</h4>
          <p>From the plot, the correlation with Health Risks and Age seems to be low, rather for the same median age group, the income and
            poverty levels have a higher correlation to the population health.</p>
